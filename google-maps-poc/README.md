# Google Maps Address Search POC

This Vite + React demo uses the Google Maps JavaScript API to search for addresses and display them on an interactive map.

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`.
2. Install dependencies with `yarn`.
3. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server.

## Scripts

- `yarn dev` – start the app in development mode.
- `yarn lint` – run ESLint.
- `yarn build` – build the app for production.

## Notes

This proof of concept stores data only in memory and has no authentication or backend services.
